## Redlist

Redlist is a platform built upon Ruby on Rails framework to share stories or anything about life of a student.
The word "STUDENT" is indeed has a broad meaning. It comprises the meaning of lifelong, ongoing process.
Everyone of us is a student whether they have formal or informal education. We believe that
everyone have something to tell about their lessons learnt from life.

In addition to the broad meaning of the word "STUDENT" mentioned above,
Redlist also focusing on student of educational institution whether they are from schools,
matriculations, colleges, or universities. The platform has advertisement pages with five
categories which are part-time jobs, job huntings, events, promotions, and scholarships.
The group pages is where students or groups of people from research laboratories to create their own
webpages to introduce theirselves.

These are the categories that we thought are important for student's life.

We also encourage everyone to contribute and improve this platform.
